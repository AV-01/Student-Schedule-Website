this is a searchable directory containing all students that went to RHS during from 2023 to 2024.
the data is 2 years old, but i just got the data for a couple other years, so i will implement those. 

aside from just being a raw directory, i put in some search and filter features, and a stats page.
                        
made over ~3 hours with python.
