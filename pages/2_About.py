this is a searchable directory containing all students that go to RHS during the 2023-2024 school year.
at the time im making this(2025), this data is 2 years old and extremeley outdated. 
but, i just happened to have the data and figured i would do something with it.

aside from just being a raw directory, i put in some search and filter features, and a stats page.
                        
made over ~3 hours with python.
